In case I forget, to add a blogpost, I must do the following:

1)
Place a blog entry in the "posts" folder whose name is the date in YYYY-MM-DD.html format.
I.E. "2026-02-30.html". Use the template to make sure you format properly.

2)
Add the entry to posts.json. Make sure the date and filename match EXACTLY (barring the .html extension).
Remember, the last entry should NOT have a comma at the end!
The entry should look something like:

  {
    "date": "2025-02-30",
    "title": "Welcome to the Zeppelin Computing Blog",
    "summary": "Our first post — a quick introduction to who we are and what we'll be writing about here."
  },


For reference, here's a "complete" version of the file:

[
  {
    "date": "2025-02-10",
    "title": "Welcome to the Zeppelin Computing Blog",
    "summary": "Our first post — a quick introduction to who we are and what we'll be writing about here."
  },
  {
    "date": "2025-02-05",
    "title": "Example Post: Why Backups Matter",
    "summary": "A placeholder post demonstrating the blog template. Replace or delete this entry."
  },
  {
    "date": "2026-02-10",
    "title": "Test JSON blog entry",
    "summary": "This is an even placeholder-er placeholder!"
  }
]
